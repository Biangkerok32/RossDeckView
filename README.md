# rossdeckview

Lite swipeable deck view similar to the one initially implemented by Tinder. 

Tested in Android 4.1 and above.

### Gradle
``` groovy
   compile 'com.diogobernardino:rossdeckview:1.1'
```

Drop me a line at [@dfbernardino][2] if you found it useful, I will be happy to know about it.

### Motivation
None of the available libraries seemed stable enough as well as able to swipe in all directions. Contrary to similar projects, I made the effort to fully decouple the view moving capabilities from the deck view itself. In case one wants to make a view swipeable without necessarily having a deck/stack behind, that can be done using the _FlingChief_ class.
